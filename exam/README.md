What are the web tools you used to create your web app? - The webtools I used are CodePen.io and Github.com

Discuss what you learned in this (a) COVID-19 web app project and (b) Web Development 1 Course/Subject.
-(a)In the course of me, making the web app project, I learned that little details are crucial especialy the elements
because even a typo can make the website not work. (b) I have learned so many things in webdev 1 becuase it was not
an easy, in fact it was hard because it is really similar to programming but with a twist of designing.

What is something you need to improve on Web Development? - I think what I lack most is design because I'm not very artistic
                                                            and I find it hard to percieve what a user likes.
